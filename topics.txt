Object-Oriented Programming or OOP's refers to the language that uses objects in programming. It is primarily concerned with the implementation of real-world entities such as inheritance, polymorphism, etc. in programming. For instance - in the class of Living Things; Humans, Animals, Plants, Microorganism, etc. are known as an object. OOP is used to solve real-world problems. OOP has several additional advantages like faster and easier to execute, provide a clear structure to the program which makes others easier to read the code, it uses the DRY principle "Don't Repeat Yourself" which makes code easy to maintain modify and debug.

Also, OOP is not only important for Academic Exams but also very crucial in Interviews, especially for Fresher's Interviews. There are a lot of topics in OOP and in this roadmap, we will discuss all these topics in sequence. If any fresher or Student will follow this Roadmap, he/she will definitely crack the Interview as well as College or University Exams based on OOPs Programming.
1. First Step

Before moving forward for learning OOP's Concept, one must have basic knowledge about the fundamentals and syntax of C++, Java, Python, or any other relevant programming language. It will help you to implement the OOPs concepts in programming conveniently.
2. Second Step

After that, you must follow the Overview Points of OOP's concept like:

    What Is Object-Oriented Programming?
    Object-Oriented Programming relation with the real world and how real-world problems can be solved by it.
    Why we Study Object-Oriented Programming and why it is important to learn?
    Limitations and advantages of OOP
    Difference between Procedural and Object-Oriented Programming?
    Why OOP is preferred over Procedural Programming Language?

So, before diving deep into the OOP concepts - one must have knowledge about the above questions. For answers or reference to these one can follow - GeeksforGeeks website or any recommended book. The important books for learning OOP are as follows:

    For C++ : Object-Oriented Programming with C++ by E.Balagurusamy.
    For JAVA : Java: The Complete Reference by Herbert Schildt.
    For Python: Mastering Object-oriented Python Book by Steven F. Lott.

3. Third Step

Now after following the above steps we will move further about the Pillar's of Object-Oriented Programming Language as follows:

    What is Class
    What is Object
    Difference between Class and Object.
    Use of Classes and Object Inside and Outside of Main Class.
    Can Class and Object exist or use Individually?
    Real-World Analogy Of Class and Object.
    Access Modifiers (public, private, protected, etc.)
    Member Function(Inner and Outer class function)

4. Fourth Step

Important Keywords to learn:

    Static Keyword
    Virtual Keyword
    Abstract Keyword
    Final Keyword
    Explicit keyword
    This Keyword
    new Keyword
    const keyword
    super keyword

One must have knowledge about these keywords like their definition, uses, pros, and cons, etc., and why it is important to learn.
5. Fifth Step

Constructor and Destructor :

    Definition and Working.
    Rules and Types.
    Purpose of Using Constructor and Destructor
    Difference between Constructor and Methods (In Java)
    Can Constructor Perform Other Task rather than Initialization?
    Does Constructor Return any value?
    Constructor vs Destructor.
    Is there any Constructor Class?

6. Sixth Step

Features of OOPS

Polymorphism: In this, one must know:

    What is Polymorphism
    Categories: Function/Operator overloading, Compile time polymorphism, Function overriding, Runtime Polymorphism
    Which function can be overloaded and which functions can't be overloaded with explanation
    Virtual function
    Dynamic Binding
    Virtual Class
    Derived Class
    Inline Virtual Function
    Abstract Class
    Pure virtual function
    Pure Virtual Destructor
    Instanceof Operator

Inheritance:

    Subclass
    Superclass
    Reusability
    Need for Inheritance
    Can OOP exist without Inheritance
    Inheritance types (Single, Multiple, Hierarchical, Multilevel, Hybrid, Virtual Inheritance)
    Real-life examples of Inheritance
    Limitation of Inheritance
    Sealed Modifier
    Object Slicing

Encapsulation

    Definition
    Need
    How to achieve
    Real-World Example
    Packages (In Java)

Abstraction

    Definition
    When to use
    How to Achieve
    Difference between Inheritance and Abstraction
    Difference between Encapsulation and Abstraction

Other's

    Dynamic Binding
    Message Passing
    Object Cloning
    Wrapper Class

So there are the important OOPs topics for Interview and Academic Examination which if followed properly will sure get you the success.

Also, these topics must be covered by following the important  principle of learning:

    Get in-depth knowledge about the topic.
    Must know Implementation details.
    How it is related to the real world.

7. Seventh Step

    Important Interview Questions Of OOP Concept:
    C vs C++ vs Java vs Python (Just get the idea of how they are different)
    Difference between Procedural and OOP language?
    Why Java is not a pure Object-Oriented Programming Language?
    Is an Array a Primitive type or an Object in Java?
    What is early and late binding?
    What is the default access modifier?
    How many instances can be created for an abstract class?
    Define Garbage Collection and how does it work?
    Define Manipulators?
    What do you mean by Final block?
    What is the final variable?
    What do you mean by exception?
